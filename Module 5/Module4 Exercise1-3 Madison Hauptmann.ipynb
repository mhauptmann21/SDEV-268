    "1. Dynamic Programming is a problem-solving technique used when a problem can be broken down into smaller overlapping subproblems. Instead of solving the same subploblems repeatedly, Dynamic Programming stores the results so they can be reused later.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You should Dynamic Programming when a problem has overlapping subproblems or optimal substructure. If the same subproblems are solved repeatedly, then it beneficial to use Dynamic programming. Also, if an optimal solution can be built from the solutions of smaller subproblems, then Dynamic Programming becomes very helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dynamic Programming has two main approaches: Top-Down and Bottum Up. The first method, Top-Down, uses recursion to write the solution, stores answers to subproblems so that they aren't recomputed, and it solves only the subproblems needed. The next method, Bottom-Up, uses loops to build a table iteratively from the smallest subproblems up to the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The advantages of Dynamic Programming incudle that it is very efficient and avoids repeated calculations, it reduces time complexity, it guarantees optimal solutions, and it transforms recursive problems into iterative, stable ones."
