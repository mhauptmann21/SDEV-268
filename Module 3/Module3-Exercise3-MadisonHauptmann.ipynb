    "8.3-4 (page 215), Suppose that COUNTING-SORT is used as a stable sort within RADIX-SORT. If RADIX-SORT calls COUNTING-SORT d times, then since each call of COUNTING-SORT makes two passes over the data (lines 4-5 and 11-13), altogether, 2d passes over the data occur. Describe how to reduce the total number of passes to d + 1."
