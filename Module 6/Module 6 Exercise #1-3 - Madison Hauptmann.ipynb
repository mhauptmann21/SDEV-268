Consider a vertex u with δ(s,u) = k + 1. there exists a shortest path s⇝⋯⇝w⇝u where δ(s,w) = k. By the induction hypothesis, w is discovered and enqueued with w.d = k. When w is dequeued (which happens before any vertex of distance k + 1 is dequeued), BFS inspects w's adjacency list and will sicover u ( or some vertex on another shortest path to u), assiging u.d = k + 1. Order inside adjacency lists may change which neighbor of a distance-k vertex is discovered first, but it cannot change the fact that some neighbor at distance k gets to discover u and thus u recieves k + 1.\n",

    "        - The parent pointers (which neighbor first discovered u) can differ if multiple neighbors of u are at distance k. That choice depends on adjacency list order; hence the shape of BFS tree may change while all d-values remain the unique shortest distances."
